Hey, brother, what you're thinking?
Leave that old record spinning
You feel the rhythm, going
They call it lonely digging

Let's end your time to lay low,
Your knees are bending, so
It's time to get up and let go
You're gonna come undone

Hey, mama, how's it going?
Can't see your body moving
Don't leave the party dying
They call it lonely digging
